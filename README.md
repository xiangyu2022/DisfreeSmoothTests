## Files and repositary description

- **`hjs.R`**
This file contains the normalized shifted Legendre polynomials on the interval [0,1]. Please download and load this file before running the remaining code introduced below.

- **`Code_Sec3-1.R`**  
  This file implements simulation studies examining smooth tests via projected bootstrap, as described in Section 3.1 of [1], and generates plots of the simulation results.

- **`Simulation_Code_Sec4-2_Proj_Boot.R`**
  This file implements simulation studies described in Section 4.2 of [1]. 

- **`Plots_Code_Sec4-2.R`**  
  This file generates histograms of the distributions considered in Section 4.2 of [1] and plots the simulation results. Please run the simulation code before running the plotting code.

- **`Dataset_Sec5`**
  This repository contains the dataset for the case study described in Section 5 of [1]. 

For any technical inquiry, please contact **Xiangyu Zhang** at [zhan6004@umn.edu](mailto:zhan6004@umn.edu).
