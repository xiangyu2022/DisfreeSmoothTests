# Distribution-free goodness-of-fit test for angular power spectrum models 

This repository contains code demonstrating how to apply distribution-free smooth tests to angular power spectrum models, as described in the following article.

  *Distribution-free data-driven smooth tests without 𝜒2*  
  submitted to *Electronic Journal of Statistics*.

## Code and Simulation Results

Two folders—`codes_PRD` and `codes_PRL`—contain the code for simulation and figure-generation scripts for the submitted PRD and PRL papers, respectively.

For any technical inquiry, please contact **Xiangyu Zhang** at [zhan6004@umn.edu](mailto:zhan6004@umn.edu).
